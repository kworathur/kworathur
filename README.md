Hi, I'm Keshav. I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student at the [University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/), pursuing an H.B.Sc in Computer Science. I'm interested in applying ML to bioinformatics and healthcare. I'm also interested in developing computer vision algorithms for scene understanding and synthetic data generation.
