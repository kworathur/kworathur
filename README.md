# Keshav Worathur

Hi, I'm Keshav. I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student at the [University of Toronto](https://[www.utoronto.ca](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/)/), currently pursuing a H.B.Sc in Computer Science. I enjoy using my experience in agile software development and instinct for automation to deliver high-quality software. I'm also interested in machine learning for the purpose of building learning healthcare systems. 

Learn more about me on my website and via my resume.
