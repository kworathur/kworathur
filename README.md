# Hi, I'm Keshav 

I'm a **software engineer** with over a year of professional experience working with Typescript and Python to develop test automation software and AI apps.

📚 I'm currently pursuing my master's in Computer Science with a specialization in ML at Georgia Tech! I graduated with an HBSc in CS from the University of Toronto in 2025.

🌱 Learning about REST API development and single sign on (SSO)

⚡️ My tech stack: Typescript (React, NextJS, Playwright), Python (PyTorch, SKLearn, Pandas)

👷🏽‍♂️ Currently building a startup in the higher education space (stay tuned!)
